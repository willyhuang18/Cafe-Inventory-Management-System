Project Description
Brew.Base is a web-based inventory management platform for small and medium-sized cafes. It digitizes two workflows: menu management (with soft-delete archiving) and inventory tracking (with cost/restock analytics). Built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Bootstrap 5, and vanilla JavaScript client-side rendering.
